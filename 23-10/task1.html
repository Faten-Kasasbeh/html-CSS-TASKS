<h1>Page-Level & inline CSS Styling</h1>
<p style="color: orange ;"> Cascading Style Sheet or CSS is a style sheet language, which defines how an HTML page should be presented. 
It basically styles the presentation of a particular piece of markup language code. There are three ways to i
nclude CSS in any HTML code, which are, External, Internal and Inline. While we call the externally defined style sheet in our page 
in the External method, we define the style within
in the same HTML code in the Internal method. 
It uses style attributes for styling elements.
 Internal CSS is included in the same HTML page, as it is used for styling the elements being used in the code.</p>

    lement of the HTML code. In the case of Inline Style CSS, 
    style is treated as an attribute of any particular element, which has various properties and is used for the unique styling of any HTML element. 
    We will demonstrate the use of inline CSS through some examples:
